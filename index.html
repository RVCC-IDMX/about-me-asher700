                <p>
                    It has enabled me to persue passions I love as a career path. 
                    It has also allowed me to meet many like minded people whom I feel share those same passions as me. 
                    I am unsure of where I would be without RVCC but I am grateful to have participated in my years here, 
                    its been fun and stressful and all the more memorable for it

            <h2>An Excerpt From Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde</h2>
            <div>
                <p>“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.</p>

                <p>“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”</p>
                
                <p>But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward.
                     “What!” he thought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in his veins.</p>

                <p>
                    Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury;
                    but Mr. Hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed. Much of his past was unearthed,
                    indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile life, 
                    of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper. 
                    From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually,
                    as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. 
                    The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.
                    Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. 
                    He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; 
                    and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion.
                    He was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.
