                    I am unsure of where I would be without RVCC but I am grateful to have participated in my years here,

            <h2>CSS Image Hover Effects: An Overview </h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Within CSS there are a gazillion different and equally cool ways ot manipulate an image to add flavor to your
                    website. My favorite of these has to be image hover effects. Image hover effects are used when a mouse cursor moves
                    over an image and applies a certain overlay atop the image. The entire look and feel of the variety of effects 
                    is extremely slick and adds legitimacy to your webpage. Below will be examples of all the different variations on a hover
                    effect that I enjoy seeing, as well as how they work.
                <p>

                    
                <p>
                    With image hover you can apply things like an image fade in effect. This is where hovering causes the image to be
                    dissapated into a new background color and potentially some text or even an icon. You can also apply various styles to
                    the text within the hover effect. Next is slide, similar as they all are to one another the difference is that slide will
                    scoot into view once hovered over, this can be a new image overlapping the first or even some more cool text for the user to
                    be in awe of. The next is the zoom effect, wherein hovering causes the center of the screen to bloom out into the new overlay of
                    text and styling.
                </p>
               
                <p>
                    Image hover effects also are not as flashy as the effects listed above, they can even come down to the inversion of color
                    schemeing when hovered over like the navbar options on the top of the page. The effects can be as minimal or as massive
                    as a developer sees fit. This flexibility makes for a great tool that can be harnessed and innovated on at any time. 
                    Another favorite effect of mine is adding a dropshadow on hover, as though the mouses hovering was causing the image to float
                    slightly.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    With all that said, I believe putting these to use all over websites is a great idea as it is extremely versatile and 
                    relatively simplistic to implement. For something as basic as image hovering invert all you need to do in CSS is apply 
                    a color inversion on mouse focus of a clickable item. Leveraging that means that you can make your website come to life with
                    just a hovering of the mouse, giving the user a sense of wonder and the urge to focus on everything your website holds within,
                    just to see how it will react. This power means that you can apply cool effects and ensure a user who will pay attention
                    to the very end and not click off the website. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the course of my research regarding the implementation and usage of these effects, I learned alot about staying 
                    creative with any and all tools at my disposal, something that we find ubiquitiously throughout the internet can be used
                    to truly wow a user and gain a potential follower along the way. While being relatively fun to create. That is something
                    special. Below will be the examples using a previous image with some of the aforementioned hovering effects applied
                </p>
